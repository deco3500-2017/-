OVERVIEW

Moonlight is a location based assistance application with the intention of solving the fundamental issues associated with receiving help from unknown parties and establishing trust. The basic application will allow users to request general assistance, reach out to find others to interact with socially, and receive help in emergency situations. By exploring the environment of “The Active Community”, Moonlight hopes to gain further insight into the how people establish trust with one another via the means of representation and reputation within a digital system.


The initial idea of Moonlight was to promote a feeling of safety by better connecting people with a geographical proximity. The use case driving this application was the concept of someone wanting someone else to walk them to their car after a late lecture. The key target was an application that would allow people to feel safer.

The primary dilemma addressed by the application is how to establish a sense of community with others in your area. The app will seek to create and nurture mutually beneficial relationships with these people, without prior establishment of trust.

AIMS

Our aims for the Moonlight app from the outset are to build trust with users, build trust between users and ultimately eradicate the issues that are described above. One of the main issues that will be faced during development of the app is to ensure the safety of the users, it is imperative to our success and our values that we do not create a system capable of being exploited for malicious reasons.

Establishing Trust

Trustmark

Once identity is positively established. Then an objective rating system can be applied that ensures no abuse will go unpunished. Due to the nature of the application, and the dangers associated, it was decided that any abuse could not be forgiven, and would need to result in a permanent ban.
This resulted in the concept of a TrustMark. This is associated with each user, and is a sign that a user has not commited any offence, and has uploaded a government ID. This would be revoked if any abuse was committed.
