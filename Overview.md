<h2>Idea</h2>
The initial idea of Moonlight was to promote a feeling of safety by better connecting people with a geographical proximity. The use case driving this application was the concept of <i>someone wanting someone else to walk them to their car after a late lecture</i>.</br></br>

<ul>
<li>Making people feel safe with strangers</li>

</ul>
