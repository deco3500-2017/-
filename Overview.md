<h2>Idea</h2>
<h3>Initial Idea</h3>
The initial idea of Moonlight was to promote a feeling of safety by better connecting people with a geographical proximity. The use case driving this application was the concept of <i>someone wanting someone else to walk them to their car after a late lecture</i>. The key target was an application that would allow people to feel safer.

<h3>Early Feedback</h3>
The course coordinator was contacted early in the development process for feedback. Key areas of focus were isolated from this feedback (emphasis added to quote).

<q>
Yes, I would say that is in the problem domain. Establishing trust & ensuring safety are definite challenges for community based applications - especially communities where people <b>don't already know each other socially</b>. 
Exploring the concept of trust/safety would be interesting - though you would want to <b>focus on a particular sector/area</b> (ie. communities connecting strangers) to help constrain it.
</q></br>

From this the following requirements of the intial idea were developed:
<ul>
<li>A way to develop trust between strangers</li>
<li>A way to facilitate this development of trust</li>
</ul>
