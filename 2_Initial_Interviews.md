<h1>Results</h1>
When an individual or group was approached there appearred to be a moment of pause of the person. Some difficulties were that the initial act of breaking the ice and allowing someone to be interviewed. A number of factors that made this initial step difficult were:
<ul>
<li>Heading to class</li>
<li>Running late</li>
<li>English skills</li>
<li>Involved in group conversation</li>
<li>Studying</li>
</ul>

Adding to these problems that gave us some insight of helping the interviewers break the ice, 3 males appproaching a single female student asking if they would like to particpate in a survey may of appearred a bit strong, thus putting the potential interview on guard and not wanting to communicate further.
