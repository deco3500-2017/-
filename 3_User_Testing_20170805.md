<h1>3. User Testing - 5th of August, 2017</h1>

<h2>Aims</h2>
After the initial interviews, focus has been given to see if the public perception of the concept can be altered towards a more positive light. By creating a series of mock-ups and implement them into a prototype, more context can be established with the users and the services our application can offer.

<h2>Goals</h2>
By users participating in testing this current iteration of the prototype, we hope to gain insight of the flow of the user interaction and journey throughout the application. Observations into how comfortable users feel using this application and the selection criteria for looking for an assistant; <i>do</i> they or <i>could</i> they trust the person the application suggests?

<h2>Materials</h2>

<h3>Mockups</h3>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
Participants will be recruited in a similar way as our initial interviews<a href="#R1">[1]</a> and asked if they would like to assist in some testing of prototype. Once agreed upon, participants will be asked to use a prototype of the application while audio and screen capturing are recorded whilst observations are being made.
