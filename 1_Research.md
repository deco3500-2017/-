<h2>Uber</h2>
<h3>Community Benefits</h3>
https://www.uber.com/en-AU/safety/<br>
Uber has successfully established itself as an organisation centred around safety and ensuring the satisfaction of its drivers and riders alike. They have taken the initiative to ensure that they have a positive impact in every community in which they operate, and consistently reach outside the bounds of their job desciption in order to achieve this. Studies have revealed a strong correlation between Uber's presence in cities and a reduction in the amount of drunk driving.<br>

Uber has made their service accessable 24/7, so they are always available. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on Uber's ability to operate in times of emergency as they are heavily relied upon to transport customers to a safe destination. In addition, Uber utilizes its extensive network of driver partners during times of emergency by using its Uber Partner app to send AMBER alters (child abduction) to all drivers who are online, because in their own words:<br>
"the more eyes we have on the road, the safer we all are."

<b>conclusions:</b> Uber's focus is clearly on improving the communities in which they operate, not just providing a successful taxi service. This mindset is undoubtedly one of the main driving forces behind the company's success. Similarly, Moonlight will take the approach of improve saftey in the communities in which it is present. Initially the app will focus mostly on connecting members of the community to increase safety and mitigate potentially unsafe situations. However, it is critical to the success of Moonlight as a company that mindset be towards always improving community safety through whatever means possible, not just constrained to providing a successful app based service. That being said, the remainder of this document will focus specifically on functionality, security, and trust critical to the initial success of Moonlight as a mobile application.

<h3>Driver Safety</h3>
https://www.uber.com/en-AU/drive/safety/<br>
Uber places a great amount of importance not only onto the rider's safety, but also the safety of the drivers. A number of security/safety mechanisms have been developed to ensure diver safety during every stage of the Uber process (before, during, and after the trip).<br>

<b>Before the Trip</b>
- No anonymous pickups: all riders are required to create an account and provide their name and phone number as a minimum before they are able to request a ride. They are also able to link social accounts and provide a profile picture of themselves. This way, when a driver is picking up a rider they will know who they are and so will Uber.
- Substitute phone numbers: in many of the locations in which Uber operates around the world they utilize technology that anonymizes rider and driver phone numbers so that they are able to call and message each other while keeping their personal information private.

<b>During the Trip</b>
- In-app navigation: the Uber app automates the navigation system. When a rider initially orders an Uber they set the destination, once they are picked up by a driver the Uber app automatically provides turn by turn navigation so that drivers can focus on reaching the destination safely.
- Always on the map: GPS data from both the driver and rider's mobile devices is logged so that Uber knows who the driver and riders are and where they are going. This promotes accountability and encourages good behaviour. 

<b>After the Trip</b>
- Automated payments: once a trip is completed, the fare is charged to the rider's selected method of payment (e.g. Paypal), removing both the need to carry cash, and the potential dangers that are associated with it.

<h3>Rider Safety</h3>
https://www.uber.com/en-AU/ride/safety/<br>
Rider safety is one of Uber's top concerns. To ensure that all riders are safe, a number of security features have been designed to ensure that everyone is kept safe during every phase of the service.<br>

<b>Before the Trip</b>
- Safe pick-ups: the Uber app automatically finds your location to provide door to door service. Meaning the riders are kept safe wherever they are until their driver arrives.
- Open to everyone, everywhere: all ride requests are blindly matched with the closest available driver. So there is no discrimination based on race, gender or destination.
- Driver profiles: when riders are matched with a driver, they are provided with the driver's name, license plate number, photo and rating - so that they know who's picking them up ahead of time. Furthermore, riders are able to contact the driver after the trip if they have left something behind. 

<b>During the Trip</b>
- Share ETA: once a rider has been picked up, they have the option to share their ETA with friends and family so they can follow the route and know when to expect their arrival. 
- Always on the map: riders can follow their trip in real-time so they always know where they are. 

<b>After the Trip</b>
- Anonymous feedback: after every trip, riders are given the opportunity to rate the driver and provide anonymous feedback about the ride. Uber reviews all feedback to ensure their goal of making every ride a great experience is achieved.
- 24/7 support: the Uber support team is available 24/7 to respond to any questions that riders may have about their trip and to help the retrieve any lost items. 
- Rapid response: Uber's specially-trained response team is available around the clock to handle any urgent concerns.

<h3>Trust</h3>
https://www.airbnb.com.au/trust

- Identification: guests and hosts have the ability to scan and connect a government ID to their Airbnb accounts.
- Profiles & Reviews: hosts are able to distinguish themselves from the rest by providing detailed, well written profiles and receiving positive, verified reviews.

- Secure payment platform: all payments are handled through Airbnb's payment platform. Guests pay through Airbnb when they book a listing. Hosts receive payment 24 hours after a guest has checked in.

- 24/7 support: world class support is offered around the clock, anywhere in the world. 

<h3>Designing for Trust</h3>
https://airbnb.design/how-airbnb-designs-for-trust/
<b>Findings</b>
 - Focus isn't on users trusting the company, but on trusting each other
 - "Design" as the mututal friend
 - AirBnB as a facilitator of social interactions
 - First impressions are important (more than half of airbnb customers are first time users at any one time)

<h3>Standards and Expectations</h3>
https://www.airbnb.com.au/standards

<h3>Establishing Trust</h3>
Findings
 - Users place emphasis on host photos when evaluating how trustworthy accomodation is.
 - Users place more weight behind a hosts profile picture, than the ratings of the accomodation.
 - Profile photos are increasingly the deciding factor, when review scores for accomodation options are similar.
 - "Trustworthiness" of photos directly relates to prices of accomodation and likelyhood of being chosen.
 - Users are more likely to trust based on reviews, rather than social biases, even when demographic similarities are a factor.

<h2>AirTasker</h2>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
https://www.airtasker.com/how-it-works/
AirTasker is perhaps the closest app to Moonlight in terms of the service that it provides. AirTasker allows people to post tasks they would like completed along with a price they would like to pay. Those willing to help (known as Airtaskers) can then bid display their interest in the job, and the person who posted the job selects someone to complete it. 
<br>
Features
- Insurance: AirTask insurance provides covers for the AirTasker worker whilst performing certain activities for liability to third parties for personal or property damage.
- Customer support: a comprehensive help center is provided for users to search for any help required, with a customer support team available to those users who remain stuck.
- Ratings and reviews: AirTaskers are reviewed on their performance after each service to ensure that users can select the right person for their job.
- Communication: AirTasker provides an in-app messaging service to facilitate communication between users. Also included is the ability to make private phone calls through the app.  
- AirTasker Pay: a secure way to pay via the use of the AirTasker system. Once a job is selected the funds are transferred into a holding account which is then passed along to the AirTasker Worker, once the job is complete.

- "Trust is important because it helps consum-ers overcome perceptions of uncertainty and risk and engage in "trust-related behaviors”; in short,trust behavior. "
