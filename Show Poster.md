### Promoting safety by better connecting people through geographical proximity.

#### What is Moonlight
Moonlight is an app targeted at creating safer communities by facilitating the meeting of those in need of help (Helpees) with those who are able to provide it (Helpers). Our goal is to increase the safety and comfort of our users by alleviating the common concerns and stresses that occur when they feel unsafe.

#### Security & Trust
Safety is Moonlights #1 priority. The app incorporates a number of security features to ensure that all users are kept safe before, during and after help has been given.
<b>Before help</b>
- Help provided anywhere, any time: Helpees are able to request help at their current location 24/7. This enables the Helpee to stay safe until help arrives. 
- Helpee choses the helper: Helpees selected the Helper from a list of available Helpers to prevent use by predators. 

<b>During help</b>
- Always on the map: GPS data from both the Helper and the Helpees mobile devices is logged in the Moonlight database, promoting accountability and safety for all users involved. 
- Discrete recording: Helpees are able to use their devices microphone to record while they are helped. This allows for extra security and dispute resolution in the case that they feel the Helper has done something wrong.

<b>After help</b>
- Anonymous rating and feedback: Once the help has been received Helpees are provided with the opportunity to anonymously provide feedback on how the Helper has performed. Ensuring that Moonlight provides only the highest level of service. 
- Helpers leave the area: Upon completion of helping, the Helper must leave the immediate area before the app finishes tracking the users. This ensures that the Helpee is left safe to go about their day once finished. 

#### How it works
Moonlight works by connecting those who are need of help with those who are able to provide it. When a user feels unsafe they are able to request help through the Moonlight app. The app will alert all registered Helpers in the near vicinity that assistance is required. Helpers then respond if they are able to provide help, and a list of all available Helpers is sent to the Helpee to select from. Once a helper is selected, they receive the Helpees location and travel to their location. The Helper then assists the Helpee with their issue. Once the issue is resolved the Helper leaves the area and the Helpee is given the opportunity to leave anonymous feedback on how the Helper performed.
