<h2>Aims</h2>
Determine how people interact in a mock situation with the application, and if there are any important areas in the interaction as a whole that have not been considered.

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Script</h3>
Participants were asked if they would take part in a 5-10 minute interaction regarding course work for DECO3500. If participants said yes, they were briefed minimalistically on the scope and idea of Moonlight, before being asked to engage in a "mock situation", whereby they would need to request help with drawing their favorite animal (a task chosen for it's short time period, and non-threatening nature). Participants were given the URL to the application and could use a mobile or desktop device to access the site.

Interactions were then ran under role. The helper would offer help as if they were a helper, and the user emulated a helpee to the best of their ability.

At the end of the interaction, any relevant issues and questions were addressed, as well as prompting for critical feedback.

<h2>Participant 1</h2>
<h3>Person 1: [Alisa - Female - Mid 20s - iPhone 5 or 6]</h3>
<ul>
<li>receptive and eager to help test the app</li>
<li>when sitting in the sun she found it very difficult to see the screen, switched to using a macbook in order to see the screen easier</li>
<li>she had an understanding of what user testing was and seemed familiar with the process</li>
<li>it was difficult to communicate what the correct URL for the app was</li>
<li>she mentioned that she thought the app was "really cool" as she was using it</li>
<li>user asked "how do you know where someone is?" when going through the process of finding the person you have selected to help you</li>
<li>user didn't know what to do with the code when initially meeting with the helper</li>
<li>Liam was very helpful with drawing the lamb and made the experience of meeting much more friendly and comfortable</li>
<li>Liam prompted user that she needed to select help completed once the helping was done</li>
<li>Liam needed to consistently tell her what the steps of the helping process were</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>she would be comfortable using the app</li>
<li>interface could be more pretty/exciting</li>
<li>didn't like feature of selecting someone of the same race/sex it made her feel uncomfortable. Upon dicussion with Liam she did reveal that it might be more useful in other situations such as the 'social' connect part of the application</li>
<li>user said they would use the recording feature</li>
(total interview took 8 minutes)
</ul>

<h2>Participant 2</h2>
<h3>Person 2: [Female - early 20s - iPhone 6 or 7]</h3>
<ul>
<li>iPhone no difficulty navigating to the URL</li>
<li>had to shift location due to connection issues when under a large concrete building (1 minute until they gave up trying under the building)</li>
<li>approx 1 minute to find a "match" for help</li>
<li>user intuitively knew what to do with the code when she met with the helper</li>
<li>how do we make to process of helpers finding the helpee easiy (especially when in a crowded area)?</li>
<li>user know to press the help done button once Liam finished helping her</li>
<li>akward 40 second period at the end when she reviewed Liam</li>
</ul>

<h3>Questions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>user thought that it was a cool app and liked the ability that you could use it to request help with a large range of things</li>
<li>user would feel safe using the app</li>
<li>thinks the app would help to build connection (Liam asked this as a leading question though)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
From an interaction perspective several features of the application could be tuned. First, migration of the "same gender / same nationality" from the standard interaction process to the settings menu could aleviate some uncomfortability experienced.

Furthermore, it would be of assistance to users to add prompts during their first help experience to understand what to do while using the application. Although intuitive, users would prefer to be guided in the use of buttons such as "End Help", allowing them to better understand the action pressing that button would initiate.

It was also observed that people were comfortable to delegate security to the application developer, and it did not need to be actively 'promoted'. Users appeared happy that the application itself purported to be safe, but did not require an understanding of the inner workings to accept this.
