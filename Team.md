While team members will have a primary role, there will be collaboration on all aspects of the project, so that no one member is entirely responsible for any particular component, and feedback can be given at every stage of development. Logistics needs will be filled by whichever team members are best suited at that time to provide them. 

<h3>Communications</h3>
Team meetings will be held weekly during the 8:00am workshop session. Daily standups will also be conducted using the team Slack channel. Additional meetings can also be organised by any member if required. 

Primary communication will occur through Slack, this was determined due to its convenience, familiarity, superior file sharing and application integrations, in addition to it allowing easy connection with course staff. Document versioning and collaboration will be managed through Google Docs, and code versioning will be managed using GitHub. File storage and synchronisation will be managed through Slack and Google Drive. 

File naming and code styling conventions will adhere to the RIFT style guide http://riftcs.com.au/public/software/RIFTCodeStyleCS2017.pdf 

<h3>Decision Making</h3>
Decision making that will affect the higher level direction of the group will be conducted during group meetings. Ideally consensus will be reached, however, if this is not possible through discussion, it will be resolved through majority vote. Failing majority vote, discussion will be re-entered until the issue can be resolved, with failure resulting in the final stage of decision being decided through coin flip or other random measure. 

Implementation specific decisions will be made by the team member that is working on the relevant aspect of the implementation, with discussion and questions raised if the team member feels they need clarification, or assistance before making that choice.

<h3>Poor performance and conflict resolution</h3>
In the event that a team member is not making their contribution to the group in full, or is otherwise causing conflict in the team, through verbal, textual or other mediums, then the other team members will first talk to the team member, and attempt to show them that they need to improve their performance, or stop their activities that are causing conflict. 

If this fails to stop the team member from causing conflict, or shirking their responsibilities to the team, then the next step is to sit the team member down, during a meeting and attempt to show them that they are not performing to an acceptable standard. 

If the team member continues to have poor performance, or causes conflict, then escalation might be required in the form of informing a tutor, or the lecturer.
