<h2>Introduction</h2>
Moonlight is a location based assistance application with the intention of solving the fundamental issues associated with receiving help from unknown parties and establishing trust. The basic application will allow users to request general assistance, reach out to find others to interact with socially, and receive help in emergency situations. 

The primary dilemma addressed by the application is how to establish a sense of community with others in your area. The app will seek to create and nurture mutually beneficial relationships with these people, without prior establishment of trust.

In traditional social networks, trust is usually established prior to interaction. This can be a barrier to assimilating location based networks, as interviews have indicated trust can take significant time to develop, preventing the rapid assimilation of location based groups.

Existing applications with the intent of providing assistance such as Airtasker, Gumtree or Upwork share similar functionality, however, there are fundamental differences in the motives behind providing assistance. The applications described above primarily cater to paid service providers, meaning interactions are transactional and do not seek to build a community. Moonlight in contrast is a free service, with the motivation behind providing assistance being driven by sense of community.

The primary differentiating function of Moonlight is the trust mark and connections components. The trust mark allows users of the application to verify, and be verified by other users as trustworthy. A rating system after each encounter will ensure only trustworthy people maintain their trust mark. 

The second differentiating component of Moonlight is the connections system. This allows helpers and helpees to connect again if they felt a connection, in a social or professional capacity. This promotes better communities, and research has shown giving and receiving help can aid in the establishment of trust. This provides a novel means of establishing networks, and adds motivation to using the application as a helper.
