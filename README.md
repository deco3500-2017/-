<h2>Summary &#x1F415;&#x1F415;&#x1F415;</h2>
Moonlight is a location based assistance application with the intention of solving the fundamental issues associated with receiving help from unknown parties and establishing trust. The basic application will allow users to request general assistance, reach out to find others to interact with socially, and receive help in emergency situations. The primary dilemma addressed by the application is how to establish a sense of community with others in your area. The app will seek to create and nurture mutually beneficial relationships with these people, without prior establishment of trust.
<br>
<br>
There are many times in life when people may feel unsafe, or in need of assistance, and interviews have suggested this occurs quite regularly. In addition, it was also found most of these situations occur when a person is alone, as although all people surveyed had established friends groups, they did not necessarily have constant access to members of this group. The rationale behind the Moonlight app is to alleviate these situations by establishing trusted connections between people in an area, allowing social connections to form, and providing access to assistance when required.

<h3>Phases</h3>
The project was undertaken in four distinct stages.
</br>
The first stage was research. Research was conducted as a team, and required investigating similar applications, as well as social concepts such as trust. 
</br>

The second stage was requirements gathering. Requirements gathering was conducted primarily through interviews. This was due to the nature of our application, which could make observational studies risky (with the potential to cause trauma, as observations could occur in situations where people might feel unsafe). The interviews were primarily contextual interviews, with some interviews featuring laddering. Once these have been processed, and a basic set of requirements have been developed, a final round of interviews were conducted to confirm this set of requirements by presenting the requirements described as a feature and use case set.  

Design was undertaken after requirements collection, and was based on iterative development methodologies, and rapid prototyping. Design began with digital prototyping, which were then followed by contextual interviews and observing peopleâ€™s interactions with the prototype. Design was undertaken by all team members, with Liam serving as the technological consultant and control designer, Craig focusing on user interaction, Matt and Luke focusing on wireframing and Sean focusing on application flow.

Construction was done iteratively, with regular reviews conducted to ensure the product developed conformed to design expectations. To assist in reducing the expectation gap, developers were included at the wireframing stages of design to ensure the inclusion infeasible technology is limited.

Our intention was to have a partially complete solution implemented by the end of the project. This qualified as any key component of the application such as the general assistance or social interface being implemented. The team completed this goal.

<h2>Who did what</h2>
<b>Craig</b> was involved in the development of all promotional material, and was responsible for recording observations during user testing. Craig also helped develop the initial interview questions.</br>
<b>Liam</b> was involved in the software development and mockup creation, and was responsible for conducting interviews and user testing during the term.</br>
<b>Sean</b> was involved in the research of similar applications, and in the research of user trust dynamics involved with "share" based applications. Sean also helped with developing and ideating concepts and ideas that contributed to the overall application design </br>
<b>Luke</b> was involved in the research of similar applications, field research by interviewing relevant parties, and in the research of peer-reviewed articles. He also developed the promotional website for Moonlight. </br>
<b>Matt</b> was involved in the research of similar applications, research into how to create and build trust, user interface refinements, and recording observations during user testing.
