<h2>Summary &#x1F415;&#x1F415;&#x1F415;</h2>
Moonlight is a location based assistance application with the intention of solving the fundamental issues associated with receiving help from unknown parties and establishing trust. The basic application will allow users to request general assistance, reach out to find others to interact with socially, and receive help in emergency situations. 

The primary dilemma addressed by the application is how to establish a sense of community with others in your area. The app will seek to create and nurture mutually beneficial relationships with these people, without prior establishment of trust.

In traditional social networks, trust is usually established prior to interaction. This can be a barrier to assimilating location based networks, as interviews have indicated trust can take significant time to develop, preventing the rapid assimilation of location based groups.

Existing applications with the intent of providing assistance such as Airtasker, Gumtree or Upwork share similar functionality, however, there are fundamental differences in the motives behind providing assistance. The applications described above primarily cater to paid service providers, meaning interactions are transactional and do not seek to build a community. Moonlight in contrast is a free service, with the motivation behind providing assistance being driven by sense of community.

The primary differentiating function of Moonlight is the trust mark and connections components. The trust mark allows users of the application to verify, and be verified by other users as trustworthy. A rating system after each encounter will ensure only trustworthy people maintain their trust mark. 

The second differentiating component of Moonlight is the connections system. This allows helpers and helpees to connect again if they felt a connection, in a social or professional capacity. This promotes better communities, and research has shown giving and receiving help can aid in the establishment of trust. This provides a novel means of establishing networks, and adds motivation to using the application as a helper. 

This document aims to outline the goals and procedure our team plans to implement in developing a prototype of the Moonlight application.

<h2>Concept &#x1F410;&#x1F410;&#x1F410;</h2>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
There are many times in life when people may feel unsafe, or in need of assistance, and interviews have suggested this occurs quite regularly. In addition, it was also found most of these situations occur when a person is alone, as although all people surveyed had established friends groups, they did not necessarily have constant access to members of this group. 

The rationale behind the Moonlight app is to alleviate these situations by establishing trusted connections between people in an area, allowing social connections to form, and providing access to assistance when required. 

Furthermore, in populated areas it is unlikely a person will be geospatially alone, if a trusted connection could be established between people in an area, it would strengthen the community as a whole by promoting inter-personal interactions. 

Have you ever required help with something simple, such as walking to your car at night, or maybe wanting someone to go to the gym with, but your friends aren’t available? This is the rationale behind the Moonlight app. We aim to connect members of the community with each other to alleviate these trivial, everyday problems. An all too familiar scenario is how our friends/family always seem to be busy when we require assistance, while someone who is ready to help may be just a house away. This is the fundamental issue that we aim to resolve.

<h3>Aims</h3>
Our aims for the Moonlight app from the outset are to build trust with users, build trust between users and ultimately eradicate the issues that are described above. One of the main issues that will be faced during development of the app is to ensure the safety of the users, it is imperative to our success and our values that we do not create a system capable of being exploited for malicious reasons.

Building trust between users and the Moonlight app will be one of the main challenges faced and it will be imperative to the success of the app. Our system is one that has great potential to solve a very real, very common problem for many people, however in order to accomplish this, the users must first trust that the app can deliver on its promise. The establishment of trust is discussed further in this document in the “Building and Establishing Trust” section.

Once trust has been established between users and the Moonlight app, we will need to overcome the next challenge. This is to ensure that Moonlight successfully facilitates connecting helpers and helpees to accomplish their goals. Users will need to feel confident and comfortable that the person they are connecting with is able to assist them with their issue and that they are there for the right reasons. 

Finally, once trust has been established between users and the app, and users with each other, the last objective  is to ensure that users are receiving the assistance they require. This means that the people who are volunteering to help are enabling the helpees to accomplish their tasks. This will be crucial to ensuring that Moonlight receives repeat users. 

<h3>Audience</h3>
The audience for the Moonlight app is wide, targeting all technologically active persons. Due to the nature of mobile application use, it is expected a large subset of the user base will consist of 18-30 year olds. In addition, to aid with scoping the application, it will initially be targeted at Australian undergraduate university students, although this target could easily be expanded. Moonlight aims to create more cohesive, helpful communities and therefore the larger and more diverse the user base, the better level of support it can offer.

Research into defining are more precise demographic will assist in understanding the users better. The focused user base can fall within a range of areas from early 20’s sociable females to mid 30’s apartment residents who needs assistance. Research into how users would use this assistance application can help determine the direction of development.

<h3>Differences from other offerings</h3>
Our app separates itself from other similar applications in several ways. Firstly, one of our app’s main focuses is to cultivate a sense of security and comfort in our users. We would like to connect those who feel unsafe or alone with others who are able to provide assistance and comfort those users. This specific tailoring of our application to safety should facilitate the development of trust.

In addition, our application also focuses on sense of community, with emphasis placed on maintaining connections after interacting through Moonlight. Other assistance applications being transactional do not directly facilitate the building of more integrated communities. Our application also offers social requests, directly supporting reaching out to people, which is a unique feature in the assistance application market. 

Finally, many other assistance applications cater to paid service providers, and as such, due to their transactional nature, do not encourage building connections.  Our application is a free community based service, ensuring the motivations behind using the application are inline with building positive communities. 

<h2>Process &#x1F408;&#x1F408;&#x1F408;</h2>
<h3>Phases</h3>
The project will be undertaken in four distinct stages.

The first stage will be research. Research will be conducted as a team, and will require investigating similar applications, as well as social concepts such as trust. This will allow us to refine the target area, and begin developing a plan for requirements gathering. All members of the team will take part, with Craig and Matt investigating alternate assistance applications, Liam and Luke investigating trust, and Sean investigating target users.

The second stage will be requirements gathering. Requirements gathering will be conducted primarily through interviews. This is due to the nature of our application, which could make observational studies risky (with the potential to cause trauma, as observations could occur in situations where people might feel unsafe).

The interviews will be primarily contextual interviews, with some interviews featuring laddering. Interviews will be conducted over a period of two weeks at the University of Queensland, and Bond University. Interviews will be initiated on the go with available people, who are receptive to being interviewed. Interviews will be designed as a team.

Interviews will be conducted from Weeks 4 to 6, and will be undertaken by Liam, Craig and Matt. Craig will collect observations at a distance, Matt will collect local observations and serve as a prop, and Liam will conduct the interview. Sean and Luke will the aid in the analysis of the results of this interview.

The initial stage of interviews will focus on the nature of trust, and how people feel with regards to safety and assistance in general. This will allow us to determine the exact requirements people have from day to day for assistance, and how best to develop an environment of trust.

The next stage of interviews will investigate how people, if provided with such an application, would use it. This will attempt to discover any features or pain points that may be present with any proposed solution.

Finally, once these have been processed, and a basic set of requirements have been developed, a final round of interviews will be conducted to confirm this set of requirements by presenting the requirements described as a feature and use case set.  

Design will take place after requirements collection, and will be based on iterative development methodologies, and rapid prototyping. Design will begin with digital prototyping, which will then be followed by contextual interviews and observing people’s interactions with the prototype. Design will be undertaken by all team members, with Liam serving as the technological consultant and control designer, Craig focusing on user interaction, Matt and Luke focusing on wireframing and Sean focusing on application flow.

The specific design stages will be a higher-level construction, which will include the overarching features and flow of the application. The next stage will be design of the general assistance interface, followed by the social and emergency interface design. After these stages, a final review will occur before the design is finalised pending construction.

Construction will also occur iteratively, with regular reviews being conducted to ensure the product being developed conforms to the design expectations. To assist in reducing the expectation gap, developers will be included at the wireframing stages of design to ensure the inclusion infeasible technology is limited.

It is intended that a partially complete solution will be implemented by the end of the project. This would qualify as any key component of the application such as the general assistance or social interface being implemented.
