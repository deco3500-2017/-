<h2>Introduction &#x1F415;&#x1F415;&#x1F415;</h2>
Moonlight is a location based assistance application with the intention of solving the fundamental issues associated with receiving help from unknown parties and establishing trust. The basic application will allow users to request general assistance, reach out to find others to interact with socially, and receive help in emergency situations. 

The primary dilemma addressed by the application is how to establish a sense of community with others in your area. The app will seek to create and nurture mutually beneficial relationships with these people, without prior establishment of trust.

In traditional social networks, trust is usually established prior to interaction. This can be a barrier to assimilating location based networks, as interviews have indicated trust can take significant time to develop, preventing the rapid assimilation of location based groups.

Existing applications with the intent of providing assistance such as Airtasker, Gumtree or Upwork share similar functionality, however, there are fundamental differences in the motives behind providing assistance. The applications described above primarily cater to paid service providers, meaning interactions are transactional and do not seek to build a community. Moonlight in contrast is a free service, with the motivation behind providing assistance being driven by sense of community.

The primary differentiating function of Moonlight is the trust mark and connections components. The trust mark allows users of the application to verify, and be verified by other users as trustworthy. A rating system after each encounter will ensure only trustworthy people maintain their trust mark. 

The second differentiating component of Moonlight is the connections system. This allows helpers and helpees to connect again if they felt a connection, in a social or professional capacity. This promotes better communities, and research has shown giving and receiving help can aid in the establishment of trust. This provides a novel means of establishing networks, and adds motivation to using the application as a helper. 


<h2>Concept &#x1F410;&#x1F410;&#x1F410;</h2>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
There are many times in life when people may feel unsafe, or in need of assistance, and interviews have suggested this occurs quite regularly. In addition, it was also found most of these situations occur when a person is alone, as although all people surveyed had established friends groups, they did not necessarily have constant access to members of this group. 

The rationale behind the Moonlight app is to alleviate these situations by establishing trusted connections between people in an area, allowing social connections to form, and providing access to assistance when required. 

Furthermore, in populated areas it is unlikely a person will be geospatially alone, if a trusted connection could be established between people in an area, it would strengthen the community as a whole by promoting inter-personal interactions. 

Have you ever required help with something simple, such as walking to your car at night, or maybe wanting someone to go to the gym with, but your friends aren’t available? This is the rationale behind the Moonlight app. We aim to connect members of the community with each other to alleviate these trivial, everyday problems. An all too familiar scenario is how our friends/family always seem to be busy when we require assistance, while someone who is ready to help may be just a house away. This is the fundamental issue that we aim to resolve.

<h3>Aims</h3>
Our aims for the Moonlight app from the outset are to build trust with users, build trust between users and ultimately eradicate the issues that are described above. One of the main issues that will be faced during development of the app is to ensure the safety of the users, it is imperative to our success and our values that we do not create a system capable of being exploited for malicious reasons.

Building trust between users and the Moonlight app will be one of the main challenges faced and it will be imperative to the success of the app. Our system is one that has great potential to solve a very real, very common problem for many people, however in order to accomplish this, the users must first trust that the app can deliver on its promise. The establishment of trust is discussed further in this document in the “Building and Establishing Trust” section.

Once trust has been established between users and the Moonlight app, we will need to overcome the next challenge. This is to ensure that Moonlight successfully facilitates connecting helpers and helpees to accomplish their goals. Users will need to feel confident and comfortable that the person they are connecting with is able to assist them with their issue and that they are there for the right reasons. 

Finally, once trust has been established between users and the app, and users with each other, the last objective  is to ensure that users are receiving the assistance they require. This means that the people who are volunteering to help are enabling the helpees to accomplish their tasks. This will be crucial to ensuring that Moonlight receives repeat users. 

<h3>Audience</h3>
The audience for the Moonlight app is wide, targeting all technologically active persons. Due to the nature of mobile application use, it is expected a large subset of the user base will consist of 18-30 year olds. In addition, to aid with scoping the application, it will initially be targeted at Australian undergraduate university students, although this target could easily be expanded. Moonlight aims to create more cohesive, helpful communities and therefore the larger and more diverse the user base, the better level of support it can offer. 

Differences from other offerings
Our app separates itself from other similar applications in several ways. Firstly, one of our app’s main focuses is to cultivate a sense of security and comfort in our users. We would like to connect those who feel unsafe or alone with others who are able to provide assistance and comfort those users. This specific tailoring of our application to safety should facilitate the development of trust.

In addition, our application also focuses on sense of community, with emphasis placed on maintaining connections after interacting through Moonlight. Other assistance applications being transactional do not directly facilitate the building of more integrated communities. Our application also offers social requests, directly supporting reaching out to people, which is a unique feature in the assistance application market. 

Finally, many other assistance applications cater to paid service providers, and as such, due to their transactional nature, do not encourage building connections.  Our application is a free community based service, ensuring the motivations behind using the application are inline with building positive communities. 

<h2>Team &#x1F984;&#x1F984;&#x1F984;</h2>
<h3>Key Roles</h3>
Research will be conducted in collaboration with all team members, who will also collaborate on the analysis of collected information. 

Liam - Backend development, control design
Craig - Frontend development
Matt - Experience design and functionality integration
Luke - Interaction design and functionality integration
Sean - Content creation

While team members will have a primary role, there will be collaboration on all aspects of the project, so that no one member is entirely responsible for any particular component, and feedback can be given at every stage of development. Logistics needs will be filled by whichever team members are best suited at that time to provide them. 

<h3>Communications</h3>
Team meetings will be held weekly during the 8:00am workshop session. Daily standups will also be conducted using the team Slack channel. Additional meetings can also be organised by any member if required. 

Primary communication will occur through Slack, this was determined due to its convenience, familiarity, superior file sharing and application integrations, in addition to it allowing easy connection with course staff. Document versioning and collaboration will be managed through Google Docs, and code versioning will be managed using GitHub. File storage and synchronisation will be managed through Slack and Google Drive. 

File naming and code styling conventions will adhere to the RIFT style guide http://riftcs.com.au/public/software/RIFTCodeStyleCS2017.pdf 

<h3>Decision Making</h3>
Decision making that will affect the higher level direction of the group will be conducted during group meetings. Ideally consensus will be reached, however, if this is not possible through discussion, it will be resolved through majority vote. Failing majority vote, discussion will be re-entered until the issue can be resolved, with failure resulting in the final stage of decision being decided through coin flip or other random measure. 

Implementation specific decisions will be made by the team member that is working on the relevant aspect of the implementation, with discussion and questions raised if the team member feels they need clarification, or assistance before making that choice.

<h3>Poor performance and conflict resolution</h3>
In the event that a team member is not making their contribution to the group in full, or is otherwise causing conflict in the team, through verbal, textual or other mediums, then the other team members will first talk to the team member, and attempt to show them that they need to improve their performance, or stop their activities that are causing conflict. If this fails to stop the  team member from causing conflict, or shirking their responsibilities to the team, then the next step is to sit the team member down, during a meeting and attempt to show them that they are not performing to an acceptable standard. If the team member continues to have poor performance, or causes conflict, then escalation might be required in the form of informing a tutor, or the lecturer.


<h2>Plan &#x1F408;&#x1F408;&#x1F408;</h2>
<h3>Phases</h3>
The project will be undertaken in four distinct stages.

The first stage will be research. Research will be conducted as a team, and will require investigating similar applications, as well as social concepts such as trust. This will allow us to refine the target area, and begin developing a plan for requirements gathering. All members of the team will take part, with Craig and Matt investigating alternate assistance applications, Liam and Luke investigating trust, and Sean investigating target users.

The second stage will be requirements gathering. Requirements gathering will be conducted primarily through interviews. This is due to the nature of our application, which could make observational studies risky (with the potential to cause trauma, as observations could occur in situations where people might feel unsafe).

The interviews will be primarily contextual interviews, with some interviews featuring laddering. Interviews will be conducted over a period of two weeks at the University of Queensland, and Bond University. Interviews will be initiated on the go with available people, who are receptive to being interviewed. Interviews will be designed as a team.

Interviews will be conducted from Weeks 4 to 6, and will be undertaken by Liam, Craig and Matt. Craig will collect observations at a distance, Matt will collect local observations and serve as a prop, and Liam will conduct the interview. Sean and Luke will the aid in the analysis of the results of this interview.

The initial stage of interviews will focus on the nature of trust, and how people feel with regards to safety and assistance in general. This will allow us to determine the exact requirements people have from day to day for assistance, and how best to develop an environment of trust.

The next stage of interviews will investigate how people, if provided with such an application, would use it. This will attempt to discover any features or pain points that may be present with any proposed solution.

Finally, once these have been processed, and a basic set of requirements have been developed, a final round of interviews will be conducted to confirm this set of requirements by presenting the requirements described as a feature and use case set.  

Design will take place after requirements collection, and will be based on iterative development methodologies, and rapid prototyping. Design will begin with digital prototyping, which will then be followed by contextual interviews and observing people’s interactions with the prototype. Design will be undertaken by all team members, with Liam serving as the technological consultant and control designer, Craig focusing on user interaction, Matt and Luke focusing on wireframing and Sean focusing on application flow.

The specific design stages will be a higher-level construction, which will include the overarching features and flow of the application. The next stage will be design of the general assistance interface, followed by the social and emergency interface design. After these stages, a final review will occur before the design is finalised pending construction.

Construction will also occur iteratively, with regular reviews being conducted to ensure the product being developed conforms to the design expectations. To assist in reducing the expectation gap, developers will be included at the wireframing stages of design to ensure the inclusion infeasible technology is limited.

It is intended that a partially complete solution will be implemented by the end of the project. This would qualify as any key component of the application such as the general assistance or social interface being implemented.

<h2>Building and Establishing Trust &#x1F416;&#x1F416;&#x1F416;</h2>
Trust as a term came into widespread usage in 1560, defined as an attitude that we have towards others we hope will be trustworthy [1], with trustworthiness being a property expressed by certain people. The definition of trustworthiness varies, from being worthy of confidence or dependable [2], to the quality of always being good, honest, sincere or otherwise [3].

For the purpose of our product, we are concerned particularly with what makes people trust others. Trust can be unconscious or conscious (tactic) [4], but regardless of the nature there are four elements required for trusting. Trust requires that the trustor be vulnerable to the trustee, that the trustor thinks well of the trustee in some domain, that the trustor is optimistic the trustee is competent in some respect, and that the trustor is optimistic the trustee will have a certain motive for acting [1].

The first difficulty in establishing trust with unknown parties is the trustee must accept a certain level of risk [5]. In addition, checks and balances imposed by the trustee that seek to limit their exposure to risk do not increase their ability to trust others, instead reducing the trust between the trustor and trustee [6]. As such, any proposed solution would require a means to impose restrictions that did not undermine the fundamental requirements of trust.

This first requirement can be addressed quite simply when one considers the difference between trust and safety. Safety is defined as “the condition of being safe from undergoing or causing hurt, injury, or loss” [7]. By promoting the safety of the application instead of the trustworthiness of the trustee, trust can be allowed to develop naturally, while still ensuring safe use. The incentives for using the application then promote people to accept this vulnerability, in turn establishing trust.

The key is the balance between the motivation to use the application, and people’s aversion to vulnerability, or risk. Risk aversion is a property observed in economics, where human behaviour leads decisions to be made favouring situations with a lower expected payoff, over a higher expected payoff as a result of the risk associated with the latter [8].

The military has performed extensive research on risk aversion in order to promote initiative. Several factors were found to encourage people to overcome risk aversion, the first being leading by example [9] which fits within the context of social learning theory [10].

This is promising for the application, as by ensuring the application is “safe”, human behaviour will naturally provide the first requirement of trust. Initially, those users who are less risk averse will use the application, as the motivation to use the application will outweigh their aversiveness. Over time, others who are more risk averse will observe this behaviour, causing the balance to shift towards use of the application, and in turn, the natural establishment of trust.

The next barrier to overcome in establishing natural trust is that the trustor thinks well of the trustee in some domain, and the trustor is optimistic the trustee is competent in some respect. This is easily provided by the application through its request response architecture.

The application will not provide request for help to those it does not feel will share fundamental values, and people will not respond to requests for help if they do not feel they will be able to competently complete them. This allows users to trust the competency of those responding to requests for help.

Finally, the requirement that the trustor expects the trustee to have a certain motive for acting. This is more difficult for the product, as ulterior motives of a malicious or non-malicious intent may exist. However, application policy can help to mitigate these motives, by providing strict guidelines on the behaviour of helpers, and penalising any reported breaches harshly. This ensures that the trustor’s perception of the trustees motive, whether it is correct or not, aligns with their expectations and will not be challenged by the trustee.
