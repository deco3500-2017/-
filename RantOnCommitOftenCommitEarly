Like I get the principle, but really, I don't believe you should commit *every* single change you make. None the less, if that's what puts team ibis in the lead, we'll do it.

Also, I question the resources added to some of these repositories *cough cough* banners / images / etc *cough*, technically this is a _text_ versioning system ;)
